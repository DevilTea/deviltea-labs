# @deviltea/widget-core

`@deviltea/widget-core` is a renderer-agnostic widget composition core. It
defines the cooperating `WidgetPlugin`, `WidgetSystem`,
`WidgetSystemBlueprint`, `WidgetDocument`, and `WidgetSystemRuntime` layers.
Persistence versioning, metadata, and rendering live outside the core;
source editing is limited to the revisioned `WidgetDocument` and its
JSON-domain `SourcePatch` contract.

This guide covers the full public surface. For installation and a minimal
end-to-end example, see the
[package README](https://github.com/DevilTea/deviltea-labs/tree/main/packages/widget/core#readme).
Cross-cutting Diagnostic/Result/Failure/Error conventions are maintained in the
[Widget API conventions](../../architecture/widget-api-conventions.md).

## Core model

```text
WidgetPlugin
    plugin semantic contract, built with createWidgetPlugin(type)

WidgetSystem
    instance-scoped, immutable registered plugin universe

WidgetSystemBlueprint
    immutable compiled semantic snapshot of one unknown/raw widget tree
    status: 'valid' | 'invalid'

WidgetDocument
    revisioned source + Blueprint coordinator with atomic SourcePatch commits

WidgetSystemRuntime
    executable instance of a valid Blueprint
```

```text
createWidgetPlugin(type) -> builder chain -> WidgetPlugin
createWidgetSystem({ plugins, validateStructure? }) -> WidgetSystem
system.createBlueprint(source: unknown) -> WidgetSystemBlueprint
blueprint.createRuntime(options?) -> WidgetSystemRuntime   // only when status === 'valid'
```

Ownership rules that shape everything below:

- `WidgetSystem` is instance-scoped and immutable; the registered plugin tuple
  defines that instance's TypeScript universe. There is no global/module
  augmentation, and a duplicate `plugin.type` is rejected at construction.
- A Blueprint is an immutable semantic snapshot. Editing a widget tree means
  compiling different source through `system.createBlueprint()` or
  `blueprint.recompile()`, never mutating a Blueprint in place.
- A Runtime can only be created from a Blueprint whose `status` is `'valid'`.
- Runtime state is never part of a persisted/raw widget definition.
- Runtime-changing interactions (reading another widget's state/property,
  invoking another widget's method) are only reachable through dependencies
  declared with `registerDeps`.
- Properties are transitively side-effect free: a property may read state,
  read other properties, and invoke methods, but only methods that are
  themselves transitively read-only.
- [`alien-signals`](https://github.com/stackblitz/alien-signals) owns
  dependency tracking, laziness, caching, invalidation, and batching. The
  core only defines the observable semantics layered on top of it.

## Defining a plugin

### Capability interfaces

A plugin's shape is declared once, as a `WidgetInterfaces`:

```ts
import type { JsonValue } from '@deviltea/widget-core'

interface WidgetInterfaces {
	config?: { raw: Record<string, JsonValue>, resolved: Record<any, any> }
	slots?: string
	state?: Record<any, any>
	properties?: Record<any, any>
	methods?: Record<any, (...args: any[]) => any>
}
```

`RawConfig` is authored JSON data: its values must stay within `JsonValue`
(including nested arrays and objects with string keys). Resolved config is a
runtime domain and may use richer values.

Every section is a capability:

- absent (the key is not declared as a required property) → that capability
  does not exist, and its builder phase is skipped entirely
- present (the key is declared as a required property) → the builder requires
  that capability to be implemented completely

Presence is a declaration fact, independent of whether the capability's own
member/name domain is empty. `slots: never` (zero declared slot names),
`state: Record<never, never>` (zero declared state keys) and their
`properties`/`methods` equivalents are all **present, explicitly-empty**
capabilities — distinct from not declaring the section at all — and each
still requires (and exposes) its builder phase, completed with an empty
argument (`.slots({})`, `.state(state => state)`, ...).

There is no `pluginConfig` / `globalConfig`. Plugin-specific integration
options are ordinary factory options captured by closure around
`createWidgetPlugin(...)`, not a framework-owned config layer.

### Reading capability presence at runtime: `plugin.capabilities`

A completed `WidgetPlugin` exposes its own declaration-presence facts as a
plain, immutable object — renderer-agnostic core metadata, not an
inspection/DevTools API:

```ts
const plugin = createWidgetPlugin('counter')
	.description('A counter widget')
	.done()

plugin.capabilities
// { config: boolean, slots: boolean, state: boolean, properties: boolean, methods: boolean }
```

A consumer that already holds the exact plugin object (for example a renderer
adapter's `useWidget(plugin)`) reads `plugin.capabilities` for capability
presence instead of inferring it from Blueprint object shape or importing
`@deviltea/widget-core/inspection`. The shape intentionally matches the
inspection subpath's `BlueprintInspectionCapabilities`, but no object-identity
relationship between the two is part of the contract.

Plugin, config, and slot descriptions are required intrinsic metadata.
`system.catalog` is an immutable passive projection of the registered widget
types and their capability descriptions; it contains no Blueprint or Runtime
state.

### Builder phase order

```ts
createWidgetPlugin('counter')
	.description('A counter widget')
	.interfaces<CounterInterfaces>()
	.config({ /* ... */ }) // only if `config` is declared
	.slots({ /* ... */ }) // only if `slots` is declared
	.state(state => state /* ... */) // only if `state` is declared
	.properties(properties => properties /* ... */) // only if `properties` is declared
	.methods(methods => methods /* ... */) // only if `methods` is declared
	.done()
```

Each phase only exists on the builder chain when its capability was declared,
so a plugin with no `slots` never exposes a `.slots()` step.

`state`, `properties`, and `methods` are **not** object-map sections. Each one
is a keyed-chain builder: every declared member key becomes a chainable
method on the section object, and calling it consumes that key. The section
callback can only return once every declared key has been called exactly
once — there is no `.define()`, `.add()`, or a framework-owned `.done()` for
these three sections specifically (only the outer builder has `.done()`).

```ts
createWidgetPlugin('example')
	.description('An example widget')
	.interfaces<ExampleInterfaces>()
	.state(state =>
		state
			.count({ /* ... */ })
			.enabled({ /* ... */ }),
	)
```

### Config

```ts
interface BadgeInterfaces {
	config: {
		raw: { label?: string }
		resolved: { label: string }
	}
}

createWidgetPlugin('badge')
	.description('A badge widget')
	.interfaces<BadgeInterfaces>()
	.config({
		description: 'Badge configuration',
		validate: (input): input is { label?: string } =>
			typeof input === 'object' && input !== null,
		resolve: rawConfig => ({ label: rawConfig?.label ?? 'Badge' }),
	})
	// ...
```

- `resolve` is required and has no Blueprint/topology access — it is pure
  normalization from raw to resolved config.
- Raw config presence is own-property based: an omitted raw `config` field
  resolves as `resolve(null)`.
- An explicitly present but invalid raw config produces a Blueprint `config`
  diagnostic, the typed raw config becomes unavailable, and the semantic config
  still resolves through `resolve(null)` so the invalid Blueprint stays
  inspectable.
- `validate` is an authoritative predicate (`input is RawConfig`), not a
  coercion step.

### Slots

Unlike `state` / `properties` / `methods`, `slots` is supplied as one
complete object map — every declared slot key must be present:

```ts
interface ContainerInterfaces {
	slots: 'header' | 'content'
}

createWidgetPlugin('container')
	.description('A container widget')
	.interfaces<ContainerInterfaces>()
	.slots({
		header: {
			description: 'Header widgets',
			validateStructure: ({ children, addDiagnostic }) => {
				if (children.length > 1)
					addDiagnostic({ message: 'header accepts at most one widget', index: 1 })
			},
		},
		content: { description: 'Content widgets' },
	})
	// an optional second argument adds a plugin-level validateStructure
	// ...
```

- A resolved node's semantic `.slots` map always contains exactly the
  declared slots, each a complete (possibly empty) array — an omitted or
  malformed raw slot resolves to `[]`.
- Structural validation runs slot-level → plugin-level → system-level (see
  [Compiling a blueprint](#compiling-a-blueprint)).
- Unknown raw slot keys are excluded from the semantic slot map but remain
  navigable through the Blueprint's recovered source topology.

### State

```ts
createWidgetPlugin('counter')
	.description('A counter widget')
	.interfaces<CounterInterfaces>()
	.state(state =>
		state.count({
			validate: (input): input is number => typeof input === 'number',
			default: () => 0,
		}),
	)
```

- `validate` is the authoritative predicate for every candidate: initial
  defaults, `overrideStateDefaults`, and every `RuntimeState.set()` call.
- `default` is optional; when absent, state starts as `null` until a
  successful write. Its declared return type is not runtime authority — the
  produced value is still run through `validate`.

### Properties

```ts
createWidgetPlugin('counter')
	.description('A counter widget')
	.interfaces<CounterInterfaces>()
	.properties(properties =>
		properties.doubled({
			registerDeps: ({ dep }) => ({
				count: dep.self.state.get('count'),
			}),
			compute: ({ deps }) => {
				const count = deps.count()
				return (count.ok ? count.value ?? 0 : 0) * 2
			},
		}),
	)
```

- `registerDeps` is optional and runs once per Blueprint snapshot (not per
  runtime evaluation); recompiling produces a new Blueprint and may register a
  different dependency graph.
- `compute` receives the materialized `deps` (executed dependency callables),
  the current widget's Blueprint node, a valid-Blueprint view, and an diagnostic
  collector.
- A property's dependency grammar has no `state.set` at the type level —
  properties cannot write state, directly or transitively.

### Methods

```ts
createWidgetPlugin('counter')
	.description('A counter widget')
	.interfaces<CounterInterfaces>()
	.methods(methods =>
		methods
			.increment({
				validateArgs: (args): args is [number] =>
					args.length === 1 && typeof args[0] === 'number',
				registerDeps: ({ dep }) => ({
					count: dep.self.state.get('count'),
					setCount: dep.self.state.set('count'),
				}),
				execute: ({ args: [step], deps }) => {
					const current = deps.count()
					const value = (current.ok ? current.value ?? 0 : 0) + step
					deps.setCount(value)
					return value
				},
			})
			.reset({
				validateArgs: (args): args is [] => args.length === 0,
				registerDeps: ({ dep }) => ({ setCount: dep.self.state.set('count') }),
				execute: ({ deps }) => { deps.setCount(0) },
			}),
	)
```

- `validateArgs` is required for every method, including zero-argument
  methods (`args is []`), and is the authoritative boundary for the
  invocation's arguments.
- Method dependency registration never binds invocation arguments — a
  registered `methods.invoke('name')` dependency is a callable that accepts
  runtime arguments when the consumer calls it, validated by the *target*
  method's own `validateArgs`.
- Unlike properties, a method's dependency grammar includes `state.set`.

### Dependency grammar

`registerDeps` receives a `dep` builder. Its return value (`RegisteredDeps`)
may be an arbitrary readonly object/array/tuple whose leaves are dependency
expressions — the container shape is free organization, not a static data
transport.

| Target | Existence | Typing | `.optional()` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dep.self` | guaranteed | precise, capability-aware for the current plugin | not applicable |
| `dep.root` | guaranteed | unknown (refine with `.validate()`) | not applicable |
| `dep.parent` | may be absent | unknown | available at the target stage |
| `dep.widget(id)` | may be absent | unknown | available at the target stage |

Operations available per target, by consumer:

| Operation | Property consumer | Method consumer |
|---|---|---|
| `state.get(key)` | yes | yes |
| `state.set(key)` | no (not on the type surface) | yes |
| `properties.get(name)` | yes | yes |
| `methods.invoke(name)` | yes, only if the target method is transitively read-only | yes |

```ts
dep.parent
	.optional()
	.properties.get('label')
	.validate((value): value is string => typeof value === 'string')
```

- `.optional()` only changes target *existence*; it never suppresses
  ambiguity, an unresolved target, a missing capability/member, a refinement
  failure, or a target operation failure.
- When an optional target is absent at runtime: `state.get` / `property.get`
  / `method.invoke` succeed with `null` (skipping `.validate()` entirely),
  and `state.set` is a silent no-op that still succeeds with the original
  candidate — never `T | null`.
- `.validate()` is available only on readable leaves (`state.get`,
  `property.get`, `method.invoke`'s return value), is pure and repeatable,
  and only narrows; it is never available on `state.set` or on method
  invocation arguments.
- Reads/invokes materialize as zero/variadic-argument callables returning an
  `ExecutionResult`; a target's own failure is wrapped one-to-one into a
	  consumer-local `dependency-target-failed` / `dependency-value-rejected` diagnostic rather
  than exposed as the target's own diagnostic type.

## Compiling a blueprint

### Compilation boundary and recovery

```ts
const blueprint = system.createBlueprint(source) // source: unknown
```

The input is `unknown` on purpose — JSON-parsed or otherwise untrusted
document data is the real boundary. Compilation never throws merely because
the input is malformed; it always produces an inspectable Blueprint through
best-effort recovery, down to a recovered root.

A node becomes **resolved** once its `WidgetId`, plugin `type`, and a
matching registered plugin are all established. After that point, config,
slot, structure, or dependency errors keep the node resolved while the
Blueprint as a whole becomes invalid — only a genuinely unrecoverable
identity (missing/invalid id or type, unknown plugin type) produces an
**unresolved** node.

Navigation works on both valid and invalid Blueprints:

```ts
blueprint.root
blueprint.getWidget(id)
blueprint.getParent(node)
blueprint.getLocation(node)
blueprint.getChildren(node)
blueprint.getChildrenAt(node, slot)
blueprint.diagnostics
```

`getChildren` / `getChildrenAt` walk the recovered *source* topology; a
resolved node's `.slots` field is the separate, complete *semantic* topology
(only declared slots, every declared slot present).

### Diagnostics

Every diagnostic has top-level `code`, `location`, and `message` fields.
Variant-specific facts are direct fields; structured `path` and `related` are
not nested under a generic `source` object. Codes are stable lowercase
kebab-case values.

| `code` family | Owns |
|---|---|
| `invalid-widget-*` / `unknown-widget-type` | malformed widget identity and authored shape |
| `invalid-widget-config` | `config.validate` failures on a resolved node |
| `invalid-widget-structure` | slot-level / plugin-level / system-level `validateStructure` failures |
| `*-dependency-*` / `property-evaluation-cycle` | dependency target/member failures, Property purity violations, and Property-containing evaluation cycles |

```ts
for (const diagnostic of blueprint.diagnostics) {
	console.log(diagnostic.code, diagnostic.location, diagnostic.message)
}
```

### Status and recompilation

```ts
type WidgetSystemBlueprintStatus = 'valid' | 'invalid'
```

Only `status === 'valid'`:

- narrows every node query to resolved nodes
- narrows `.diagnostics` to an empty array
- exposes `createRuntime(options?)`

`sourceJsonCompatible` is the authored JSON-domain proof. In its positive
branch, `blueprint.source` and source fragments on all recovered navigation
outputs carry `JsonValue`; the false branch keeps the exact source as
`unknown`. A valid Blueprint requires semantic validity and this proof, so
Runtime creation never promotes non-JSON authored material.

```ts
if (blueprint.status !== 'valid') {
	// inspect blueprint.diagnostics — no createRuntime here
}
else {
	const runtime = blueprint.createRuntime()
}
```

Editing is recompiling, not mutating:

```ts
const next = blueprint.recompile(nextSource)
// observably equivalent to: blueprint.system.createBlueprint(nextSource)
```

### WidgetDocument and SourcePatch

`createWidgetDocument({ system, source })` keeps the current source and its
compiled Blueprint together behind a monotonically increasing revision. A
`SourcePatch` uses one JSON-domain RFC6901/RFC6902 language: paths may be JSON
Pointer strings or structured string/number segments, operands are `JsonValue`,
and successful patches use copy-on-write reconstruction. Mechanical failure
is atomic; a mechanically successful patch may still commit a semantically
invalid Blueprint for inspection.

```ts
import { createWidgetDocument } from '@deviltea/widget-core'

const document = createWidgetDocument({
	system,
	source: { id: 'counter-1', type: 'counter' },
})

const result = document.applyPatch([
	{ op: 'replace', path: '/config/step', value: 2 },
], { expectedRevision: 0 })

if (result.ok && result.changed)
	console.log(document.getSnapshot().revision) // 1
```

## Running a runtime

### Creating a runtime

```ts
const runtime = blueprint.createRuntime({
	overrideStateDefaults: {
		'counter-1': { count: 10 },
	},
})
```

`overrideStateDefaults` is an initialization-only candidate map, not a patch
API — it never mutates a running Runtime. Precedence per state member is
	`override > plugin default > null`, and every candidate (override or
default) is still run through that member's `validate`. An invalid override
never falls back to the plugin default; it leaves the state `null` with an
	ordinary `invalid-state-value` diagnostic. `createRuntime` never fails: malformed
override input (unknown widget, unknown key, wrong shape) still produces a
	Runtime, recorded as Runtime-level `unknown-state-override-*` diagnostics.

`runtime.getWidget(id)` returns a `RuntimeWidget | null` distributed over the
registered plugin tuple. When more than one plugin is registered, narrow on
`widget.type` before accessing plugin-specific `state` / `properties` /
`methods` — there is no `getWidget(id, type)` helper.

### State

```ts
widget.state.count.get() // T | null — a direct read, not an ExecutionResult
widget.state.count.set(5) // ExecutionResult<number, RuntimeStateDiagnostic>
widget.state.count.subscribe(listener) // listener: (value: T | null) => void
widget.state.count.getDiagnostics()
widget.state.count.subscribeDiagnostics(listener)
```

- An invalid `set()` preserves the previously accepted value and returns
	`{ ok: false, failure: { diagnostics } }`; a successful `set()` commits the candidate
  and clears the latest diagnostic snapshot.
- Change detection is strict `!==`: writing `NaN` again still counts as
  changed (`NaN !== NaN` is `true`), while `+0` and `-0` count as unchanged.
- Subscriptions never emit immediately upon subscribing.

### Properties

```ts
widget.properties.doubled.get() // ExecutionResult<T | null, RuntimePropertyDiagnostic>
widget.properties.doubled.subscribe(listener) // listener: (result) => void
widget.properties.doubled.getDiagnostics()
widget.properties.doubled.subscribeDiagnostics(listener)
```

Properties are lazily evaluated and cached through `alien-signals`.
`subscribe()` activates observation but never emits immediately; every
*actual* completed recompute notifies exactly once, even when the recomputed
value compares equal to the previous one. `subscribeDiagnostics()` observes a
separate diagnostic channel and never triggers a property evaluation.

### Methods

```ts
widget.methods.increment(5) // ExecutionResult<number, RuntimeMethodDiagnostic>
widget.methods.increment.getDiagnostics()
widget.methods.increment.subscribeDiagnostics(listener)
```

Every invocation runs `validateArgs` before `execute`; on failure, `execute`
	never runs and the result carries an `invalid-method-arguments` diagnostic. A successful
`execute` whose plugin/dependency diagnostics were still recorded becomes a
	failure with an `invalid-method-result` diagnostic attached — the returned value in that
case is diagnostic context only, never a degraded ok value.

Every `RuntimeMethod` invocation opens a batch boundary around its
dependency/state writes (including dependency-invoked methods, which nest);
only the outermost invocation flushes propagation. Batching means
propagation atomicity, not a transaction: writes performed before a later
failure or a thrown callback remain committed, and the batch still ends via
`finally`.

### Diagnostics

Every state write, property evaluation, and method invocation keeps only its
**latest completed** operation's diagnostic snapshot — never a history. A
callback throw discards the in-progress collector and preserves the previous
completed snapshot; it is an implementation exception, not a `Diagnostic` and not
an `ExecutionResult.failure`.

Every `RuntimeWidget` also exposes its own aggregate, present regardless of
declared capabilities:

```ts
widget.getDiagnostics() // readonly RuntimeWidgetDiagnostic[]
widget.subscribeDiagnostics(listener)
```

`RuntimeWidgetDiagnostic` is the union of only that widget's own primitive-owned
diagnostics (`RuntimeStateDiagnostic | RuntimePropertyDiagnostic | RuntimeMethodDiagnostic`) —
never a Runtime-level diagnostic, even when a diagnostic mentions the same
`widgetId`. The snapshot order is deterministic: state members -> property
members -> method members, plugin declaration order within each capability,
and each primitive's own local diagnostic order preserved. A widget with no
capabilities, or with every primitive currently succeeding, aggregates to
`[]`.

```ts
runtime.getDiagnostics() // complete aggregate: Runtime-level, then RuntimeWidget snapshots in Blueprint order
runtime.subscribeDiagnostics(listener)
```

`RuntimeWidget.getDiagnostics()` / `subscribeDiagnostics()` and
`WidgetSystemRuntime.getDiagnostics()` / `subscribeDiagnostics()`
read diagnostic signals only and never activate property evaluation. The aggregate may legitimately list both a failing
primitive's own diagnostic and a consumer's wrapped dependency diagnostic that points back at it — that is causal context,
not duplication.

### Disposal

```ts
runtime.dispose() // idempotent
```

After disposal, `runtime.isDisposed` and `runtime.blueprint` remain readable,
and previously obtained `RuntimeWidget.id` / `.type` / `.blueprint` stay
readable. Every live query/operation (`runtime.getWidget`, state/property
reads and writes, method invocations, `RuntimeWidget.getDiagnostics()`) and every
*new* subscription (including `RuntimeWidget.subscribeDiagnostics()`) throws
`WidgetSystemRuntimeDisposedError`; previously returned unsubscribe functions
remain safe, idempotent no-ops. Disposal itself emits no notification and
creates no diagnostic.

```ts
import { WidgetSystemRuntimeDisposedError } from '@deviltea/widget-core'

try {
	runtime.getWidget('counter-1')
}
catch (error) {
	if (error instanceof WidgetSystemRuntimeDisposedError) {
		// `instanceof` is the stable discriminator; the message text is not.
	}
}
```

## Inspection (DevTools)

`@deviltea/widget-core/inspection` is a dedicated, strictly readonly subpath
for building inspectors/DevTools over the compiler and Runtime. It is not
re-exported from the root entrypoint:

```ts
import { inspectBlueprint, inspectRuntime } from '@deviltea/widget-core/inspection'
```

The inspection surface only ever reports facts the core already knows or
already computed; it never sets State, invokes a Method, forces Property
evaluation, or otherwise changes the semantic behavior being inspected —
including when a subscription is active.

### Blueprint inspection

```ts
const inspection = inspectBlueprint(blueprint)

inspection.rootNodeId // InspectionNodeId
inspection.nodes // every recovered source node, pre-order, including unresolved nodes
inspection.invalidCycles // Property-containing invalid evaluation SCCs
inspection.getNode(nodeId)
inspection.getNodeId(node) // null for a foreign/forged node
```

- `inspectBlueprint(blueprint)` is lazy opt-in but eager once called: the
  first call materializes one complete, frozen snapshot, cached per Blueprint
  instance (`inspectBlueprint(blueprint) === inspectBlueprint(blueprint)`).
  Building/reading it performs zero semantic execution.
- `InspectionNodeId` is a snapshot-local diagnostic identity only — unique
  within one snapshot, valid for resolved and unresolved nodes alike, with no
  stability guarantee across `recompile()` or separate snapshots. It is not a
  domain identifier and must never be used as a dependency target.
- Each node carries the existing public `BlueprintWidgetNode` (`node`) rather
  than a duplicate DTO, plus `sourceSlots` (recovered source topology, each
  entry's `placement` is `'slot'` when the raw slot key is plugin-declared and
  `'raw-slot'` otherwise — an unresolved node's slots are always `'raw-slot'`,
  and a malformed raw slot value produces no entry at all).
- A resolved node additionally carries `capabilities` (declared vs
  explicitly-empty presence for `config` / `slots` / `state` / `properties` /
  `methods`), `semanticSlots`, and `state` / `properties` / `methods` member
  inventories in declaration order. A method's `transitivelyWrites` and the
  Blueprint's `invalidCycles` are read directly off the existing compiler
  graph analysis — inspection never re-runs its own SCC or write-effect
  traversal.
- Each `property`/`method` member exposes its declared dependencies, flattened
  to `{ path, reference, status, ... }` facts: `path` is the exact container
  path from the `registerDeps()` return root (object keys stay strings
  verbatim, array/tuple indices stay numbers — never stringified). `status` is
  `'resolved'` (with the semantically-resolved `target`), `'absent'` (legal
  optional cardinality-0 target, no Diagnostic), or `'invalid'` (every other
  resolution failure — ambiguous/missing targets carry no `targetNodeId`;
  unique-but-unresolved-target/missing-capability/missing-member failures do).
  Status is always read from compiler-authoritative data, never reconstructed
  from Diagnostics; the existing Blueprint Diagnostic surface remains the authoritative
  human-readable explanation.

### Runtime inspection

```ts
const inspection = inspectRuntime(runtime)

inspection.blueprint // === inspectBlueprint(runtime.blueprint)
inspection.getWidget(nodeId) // RuntimeWidgetInspection | null
```

```ts
const widgetInspection = inspection.getWidget(nodeId)!
widgetInspection.getState('count')
	?.getSnapshot() // { value: T | null }
widgetInspection.getProperty('doubled')
	?.getSnapshot() // never-evaluated | completed
```

- `getState` / `getProperty` return `null` only when the member/capability
  does not exist; values are dynamically `unknown`-typed (strongly-typed
  access remains the job of the ordinary Runtime surface). There is
  deliberately no Method runtime inspection in v1 — no `getMethod`, no
  invocation facts, no history.
- Both `RuntimeStateInspection`/`RuntimePropertyInspection` follow the same
  `{ getSnapshot(), subscribe(listener) }` shape: `getSnapshot()` is a passive
  read, and `subscribe()` observes *future* changes only — no immediate
  emission, and never an event log.
- Retained facts start at Runtime creation, independent of whether/when
  `inspectRuntime()` is first called. State inspection reflects the current
  authoritative value, publishing a fresh `{ value }` snapshot only when a
  write actually changes it (a rejected write publishes nothing). Property
  inspection starts `{ status: 'never-evaluated' }` and publishes a fresh
  `{ status: 'completed', result }` on every naturally completed evaluation
  attempt (ok or semantic failure) — two equal completions still notify
  twice, and a callback throw or thenable violation never replaces the latest
  snapshot.
- Reading or subscribing through inspection never activates a Property, never
  executes a Method, and never creates a tracked `alien-signals` dependency —
  even a `getSnapshot()` call made from inside an external `effect`/`computed`
  is an untracked read.
- Already-retained facts (and not-yet-obtained member facades) stay readable
  after `runtime.dispose()`, including the very first `inspectRuntime(runtime)`
  call happening after disposal — this is deliberately different from the
  live Runtime surface. Only `subscribe()` is gated on disposal: a *new*
  subscription after `dispose()` throws `WidgetSystemRuntimeDisposedError`,
  while subscriptions made before disposal are silently detached (no final
  emission) and their unsubscribe functions stay safe/idempotent. Inspection
  retains no history, method calls, timestamps, or profiling data beyond the
  already-documented current/last facts.

## Design constraints

- **Synchronous boundary.** Every framework-owned semantic callback
  (`validate`, `resolve`, `default`, `validateStructure`, `registerDeps`,
  `compute`, `validateArgs`, `execute`) is synchronous. A returned
  Promise/thenable is a contract violation on the plugin author's side, not
  a `Diagnostic` and not an `ExecutionResult.failure`.
- **Renderer-agnostic.** The core has no concept of an editor, a document
  envelope, persistence versioning/migration, or UI. A `WidgetSystemRuntime`
  is the only thing an integration/renderer layer consumes; how it's drawn is
  entirely outside this package.
- **Dependency-mediated interaction.** All cross-widget reads/writes go
  through dependencies declared in `registerDeps`; there is no ambient way
  for one widget's callback to reach into another widget's state.
- **Reactive ownership.** `alien-signals` owns dependency tracking, laziness,
  caching, invalidation, and batching; this package only builds observable
  semantics on top of it and does not implement a second reactive engine.

consolidated implementation handoff comment, together with any later accepted
amendment, is authoritative over this guide.
